          <p>akub is a seasonal flowering thistle that embodies the essence of Palestine. It is also known as cardoon.

            <br><br>
            akub works to bring celebrations of the rich diverse ingredients and culinary traditions from the region of Palestine.
            With great influence from Chef Fadi's grandmother, the food brought to the table at Akub not only captures the essence of his grandmother with the bold flavour combinations but also uses local ingredients available in Palestine. This combination leads to the uniqueness of the menu offered at akub. With the addition of Britain's seasonal produce and age-old Palestinian recipes, each dish is imaginative.
            <br><br>
            With private dining in mind, akub has 3 varied spaces for private events and parties. Whether is a business lunch, intimate dinner, or a drinks' reception. The staff at akub are delighted to accommodate to your needs.

      <div class="biography">
        <p>Fadi Kattan is the Chef and co Founder for akub. The French-Palestinian chef has been in the hospitality business for over 25 years. His father, a businessman who designs and installs commercial kitchens, works alongside restaurants as a result he has spent his entire life in restaurants.
          <br><br> He learnt the art of cooking from his mother and grandmother, whom he draws inspiration from. After being reached out to by his fellow cofounder, Rasha Khouri, in 2018 with the plan of opening a Palestinian restaurant in London Kattan's thought was "Why not?", with London being one of the most receptive cities to new flavours and tastes.
        </p>

        <p> <br> While Fadi was planning the kitchen, menu and wine list Rasha Khouri was finding the site and putting together a team of British and Palestinian investors
          <br> <br> While working on another food concept Khouri became aware of the lack of Palestinian cuisine despite London's restaurant scene being very diverse. She wanted a celebration of Palestinian food and cooking and that is what akub became. She enlisted chef and hotelier Fadi Kattan for this task. Having already won international acclaim for translating traditional Palestinian dishes into fine dining experience it was clear he was the man for the job
