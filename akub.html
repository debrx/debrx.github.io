        <p>Fadi Kattan is the Chef and co Founder for akub. The French-Palestinian chef has been in the hospitality buisness for over 25years. Having his  father, a business man that designs and installs commercial kitchens, working along side restuarants he has spent his entire life in resturants.
          <br><br> He learnt the art of cooking from his mother and grandmother, who he draws inspiration from. After being reached out to by his fellow cofounder, Rasha Khouri, in 2018 with the plan of opening a Palestinian resturant in London Kattan's though was "Why not?", with London being one of the most receptive city to new flavours and tastes.
        </p>

        <p> <br> While Fadi was planning the kitchen, menu and wine list Rasha Khouri was finding the site and putting together a team of British and Palestinian investors
          <br> <br> While working on an other food cencept Khouri became aware of the lack of Palestinian cuisine despite London's resturant scene being very diverse. She wanted a celebration of Palestinian food and cooking and that is what akub became. She enlisted chef and hotelier Fadi Kattan for this task. Having already won international acclaim for translating traditional Palestinian dishes into fine dining experience it was clear he was the man for the job
