        <h3>Eniola and Shola. Enish.</h3>
        Olushola Medupin is the co-founder and partner of Enish. He started the Enish in 2013 after noticing a gap in the market for high-quality Nigerian food.
        He grew up in a restaurant run by his mother and grandparents which in turn provided a solid foundation for him to start growing in the food business.
        One of his beliefs is that food is a powerful path of connecting people and celebrating diversity. He hopes Enish will serve as a way to inspire more people to discover and enjoy Nigerian cuisine.
        <br><br>
        With the help of his wife, Eniola Medupin, also a co-founder they have combined their expertise to wow the customers with their culinary skills.
        Eniola oversees operations, finance and business development. As a co-owner, her main responsibilities are overall direction and operational management as well as business development.
