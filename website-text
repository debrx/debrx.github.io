    P.F. Chang's Asian Table offers a contemporary and approachable culinary experience, blending traditional Asian flavors with a modern twist. Our dishes range from iconic favourites like Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lettuce Wraps to modern innovations and healthy options.

    While the first P.F. Chang’s opened in 1993, our story began in the early 1960s when our co-founder, Philip Chiang, stepped in to help run the family restaurant. He later channeled his budding culinary talents into creating modern adaptations of his family’s traditional Chinese dishes, opening his own restaurant, Mandarette. He never set out to build a global brand, but then he met the man who would become the P.F. in our name: Paul Fleming. Paul, a successful restaurateur and a regular guest at Mandarette, was so impressed with the simple, purposeful recipes being served up that he wanted to share them with the masses. With a handshake, P.F. Chang’s was born.

    Offer's a takeaway as well
